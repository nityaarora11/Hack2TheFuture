The support team suggested using the Salesforce Integration API permission set license, but the guest still faced the same error. A screen-sharing session was proposed to troubleshoot further.","Issues querying 'Lead' and 'Opportunity' objects through the API with a limited user profile.","The Salesforce API Integration permission set license extends the functionality of the Salesforce Integration user license with many of the same user and object permissions typically available on the System Administrator standard profile. You can find and review the Salesforce API Integration permission set license on the Company Information page in Setup to see what it makes available. For more information, refer to this link: https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.integration_user.htm&type=5

Since this user license was recently released on March 14, 2023, there is limited information published about what cannot be accessed under this user license. However, it is clearly mentioned that to increase the level of access for users on this profile, we need to assign a permission set with the Salesforce API Integration permission set license.

Here are some discussions confirming that access to standard objects can be achieved via the Salesforce API Integration license for integration users:
